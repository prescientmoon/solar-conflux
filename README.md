# The _solar conflux_

<!-- > Pristine yet chaotic, familiar yet mysterious, unique yet repeating — the cosmos held many secrets for those wise enough to seek them — secrets of its own volition, and shadows of those before it. [...] -->

<!-- > Luna awoke. "How many cycles have I been dormant for" — she wondered into the abyss. Having gotten out of the timeless slumber, she was starting to slowly regain herself. "I wonder what theories I'll set up this time!", she exclaimed, slowly getting excited at the prospect of figuring it all out again. She would eventually figure it out — that much the girl knew. She somehow knew that, yet couldn't figure out why, nor how. [...] -->

<!-- > She couldn't move, yet she could experiment. Observing and tinkering with the many surrounding planets, she was slowly deciphering the rules of her surroundings. Still, the path to knowledge is littered with failures, and her journey was no different. That never bothered her, though — a little gravity was always enough to make her failures dissolve into the flaming stars the system she found herself in was made out of. -->

<!-- > _They_ had provided her with these wonderful abilities — deep down, she felt that. But who _they_ were, that much had eluded her — it's like she's forgotten. Was this an effect of the cycle? Did _they_ make this happen? The questions were many, the answers few. "Oh well, can't learn more about what's left of those before me without first figuring out how these darn physics work," she said playfully, before returning to work. -->

This repository contains numerous experiments of mine which do not deserve their own repositories. It exists for archival purposes.

The repositories are properly imported using [./import.sh](./import.sh) — a dangerous script that shouldn't be run unless everything in the local repo has been backed up.

## Navigation

The experiments are currently organized based on the language they use:

- [Bash](./bash/)
- [Dart](./dart/)
- [Elm](./elm/)
- [F#](./fsharp/)
- [Haskell](./haskell/)
- [Idris](./idris/)
- [Javascript](./javascript/)
- [Lean](./lean/)
- [Lua](./lua/)
- [Odin](./odin/)
- [Purescript](./purescript/)
