This directory contains a collection of helpers I've used when changing my GitHub username. In particular, I

- created a GitHub org with my old name
- forked all my repos to said organisation
- automatically adding disclaimers to the readme about the location of the repos moving

This has the advantage of preventing a malicious user from creating an account with my old username and injecting malicious code into locations people might be referencing (e.g. my neovim plugin).
